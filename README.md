o This project develops a deep learning model to classify brain MRI scans into tumor vs. non-tumor categories. It demonstrates how AI can support early detection in medical imaging by combining:

o A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch.

o A transfer learning approach using ResNet18, which boosts performance with pretrained features.

o Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) to visualize important regions in MRI scans.
