# Brain_MRI_Tumor_Classification
This project builds a deep learning model to classify brain MRI scans into tumor vs. non-tumor categories. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can support early detection of brain tumors in medical imaging, improving diagnostic efficiency and supporting radiologists in decision-making.

The solution combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern deep learning workflows, including transfer learning and explainable AI (XAI) for model interpretability.
