• This project develops a deep learning model to classify brain MRI scans into tumor vs. non-tumor categories. It demonstrates how AI can support early detection in medical imaging by combining:

• A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch.

• A transfer learning approach using ResNet18, which boosts performance with pretrained features.

• Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) to visualize important regions in MRI scans.

Tech Stack:
1. Python
2. Pytorch (deep learning framework)
3. Torchvision 
4. scikit-learn 
5. Matplotlib (visualizations)
6. XAI

Features:
1. Built a deep learning classifier for brain MRI scans using both custom CNNs and transfer learning techniques.
2. Applied robust evaluation strategies to ensure reliable performance.
3. Incorporated methods to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.
4. Assessed model performance using standard classification metrics.
5. Enhanced interpretability with XAI techniques.
