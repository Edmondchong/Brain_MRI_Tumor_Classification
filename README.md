• This project develops a deep learning model to classify brain MRI scans into tumor vs. non-tumor categories. It demonstrates how AI can support early detection in medical imaging by combining:
• A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch.

• A transfer learning approach using ResNet18, which boosts performance with pretrained features.

• Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) to visualize important regions in MRI scans.

Tech Stack:
1. Python
2. Pytorch (custom CNN + transfer learning pipelines)
3. Torchvision (datasets, transforms, pretrained ResNet18)
4. scikit-learn (metrics, K-Fold Cross Validation)
5. Matplotlib (loss curves, confusion Matrix Visualization)
6. Grad-CAM (Explainable AI heatmaps)

Features:
1. Trained a custom CNN from scratch for brain tumor classification.
2. Implemented transfer learning with ResNet18 for improved accuracy.
3. Applied K-Fold Cross Validation for robust performance evaluation.
4. Added early stopping to prevent overfitting.
5. Evaluated model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
6. Visualized results using confusion matrix & loss curves.
7. Applied Grad-CAM heatmaps to highlight tumor regions in MRI scans.
